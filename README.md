## Bouncing Ball (Eyeball)

* A round, yellow ball that bounces around the grid is the eyeball element.

* Movement:
 When the ball collides with walls, blocks, or the paddle, it travels diagonally and changes course.

* Collision Detection:
 When the ball collides with walls, blocks, or the paddle, the game detects it and modifies the ball's path appropriately.

  ### **Initial testing plan**

I started by creating a wireframe for my website and then I began coding in HTML, CSS and JS. After that, I tested each :
***

* Check responsiveness by resizing the browser window.
* Run tests on different devices/browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Edge.
