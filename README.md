## Color Scheme
***
* Readability & Contrast: The stark contrast between black and white makes text and other critical features easy to read.
 * Red, Jounquil, and Mardi Gras are striking hues that contrast with the black background, highlighting important details and actions.
* Emotional Impact: The rich purple creates a feeling of opulence and celebration, while the thoughtful application of red and yellow adds emotional depth and excitement.
* Player immersion and engagement are improved by these emotional cues.
* Aesthetic Balance: A balanced and eye-catching aesthetic is produced by combining bright, strong highlights with a dark, neutral background.   Throughout the game, this equilibrium aids in keeping the player's attention and concentration.

## Blocks

### Block Creation:

  At the top of the gaming area, blocks are organized in a grid. Three rows, each with five blocks, are present.

 When the ball strikes a block, it is taken out of the DOM.

  A rectangular, purple paddle that the user controls.
 * Keyboard Controls: The arrow keys are used to move the paddle left and right.

## Bouncing Ball (Eyeball)

* A round, yellow ball that bounces around the grid is the eyeball element.

* Movement:
 When the ball collides with walls, blocks, or the paddle, it travels diagonally and changes course.

* Collision Detection:
 When the ball collides with walls, blocks, or the paddle, the game detects it and modifies the ball's path appropriately.
